        <h3>Welcome to YCweather.</h3>

<p> YCweather is a software package designed to graph, organize, and share weather data throughout the Southwest Montana avalanche community. This program was developed by <a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com">Andrew E. Slaughter</a> at the <a href="http://www.coe.montana.edu/ce/subzero/">Subzero Science and Engineering Research Facility (SSERF)</a>.

For detailed information regarding YCweather please download the software documentation: <a href="https://github.com/aeslaughter/YCweather/blob/master/release/help.pdf"> help.pdf.</a> </p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
YCweather is a Windows based program and installs like any other application, however it requires MATLABâ€™s Component Runtime (MCR).  
First-time users of YCweather:
<ul> 
	<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.coe.montana.edu/ce/subzero/snow/MCRinstaller.exe">MCRinstaller.exe</a>,</li> 
	<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.coe.montana.edu/ce/subzero/snow/YCinstaller.exe">YCinstaller.exe</a>, and</li> 
	<li>Run YCweather via YCweather.exe.</li> 
</ul> 
The first execution of YCweather may take several minutes, due to file decompression.  
Also, it is recommended that you install MCRinstaller using the default settings.
</p>
