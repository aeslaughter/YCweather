        <h3>Welcome to YCweather.</h3>

<p> YCweather is a software package designed to graph, organize, and share weather data throughout the Southwest Montana avalanche community. This program was developed by <a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com">Andrew E. Slaughter</a> at the <a href="http://www.coe.montana.edu/ce/subzero">Subzero Science and Engineering Research Facility (SSERF)</a>.

For detailed information regarding YCweather please download the software documentation: <a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/release/help.pdf"> help.pdf.</a> </p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
YCweather is a Windows based program and installs like any other application, however it requires MATLABâ€™s Component Runtime (MCR).  
First-time users of YCweather:
<ul> 
	<li>Download and install <a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/release/MCRinstaller.exe">MCRinstaller.exe</a> (it is recommend that you used the default settings),</li> 
	<li>Download and install <a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/release/setup.exe">setup.exe</a>, and</li> 
	<li>Run YCweather via YCweather.exe from the installed location.</li> 
</ul> 
The first execution of YCweather may take several minutes, due to file decompression.  Please note that YCweather, as discussed below, relies on <a href="http://dropbox.com"> dropbox </a> for syncing current data. Therefore, by default if you have <a href="http://dropbox.com"> dropbox </a> folder in the typical location, YCweather will automatically create a data directory inside this folder. Otherwise it will create a directory in your Documents folder or the installation directory, depending on your system. It is easy to move this database directory, details are provided in the user manual: help.pdf.
</p>

<h3>Historical Data</h3>
<p>
The following historical data sets are available (extract zip files into the database folder in the YCweather directory):
	<a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/release/09-10.zip"> 09&ndash;10</a>,  
	<a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/release/08-09.zip"> 08&ndash;09</a>,  
	<a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/release/07-08.zip"> 07&ndash;08</a>,  
	<a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/release/06-07.zip"> 06&ndash;07</a>, and 
	<a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/release/05-06.zip"> 05&ndash;06</a>.
</p>	

<h3>Current Data</h3>
The researchers at MSU maintain a current data set for YCweather using <a href="http://dropbox.com"> dropbox </a>. If you
would like access to this data please contact <a href="mailto:andrew.e.slaughter">Andrew E Slaughter</a>. Once you have been invited to the shared folder the following steps will setup YCweather to use this folder.
<ul>
	<li> Download and install <a href="http://dropbox.com"> dropbox </a> on your computer. </li>
	<li> Start YCweather. </li>
	<li> Select the Preferences option from the File menu in the YCweather application. </li>
	<li> Change the database directory to the YCweather folder within your <a href="http://dropbox.com"> dropbox </a> folder. </li>
	<li> Make the changes the default by selecting the Set Default option in the Preferences window File menu. It is also possible to save the changes to a workspace for later recall, see the YCweather user manual for details: help.pdf</li>
</ul>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>I would like to especially thank the Yellowstone Club for providing access, resources, and software testing. A portion of this work was conducted at the Montana State University Subzero Science and Engineering Facility, which was developed with the support of the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> Grant #ANT-0521360 and Murdock Charitable Trust.  A portion of this work was funded by NSF Grant #EAR-0635977, the NSF Graduate Teaching Fellows in K&ndash;12 Education Program, and research grants from the 2000 International Snow Science Workshop and the American Avalanche Association.</p>
